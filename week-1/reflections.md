# 1.1 Think About Time

The productivity and time management ideas that interested me most were the Pomodoro Technique and realizing both the importance and reality of starting small. Throughout my life, I have always been an anxious and worrisome person. However, over the years, I have begun to realize that life is about taking a step back and breaking down the different tasks and obstacles in front of you. Therefore, while I was reading about both the PT and starting small, I was quickly able to relate. The Pomodoro Technique, which involves assessing how many 25-minute time slots you need to complete a group of tasks that will allow you to reach your end goal. This is very similar to “Time Boxing,” or allotting a set of time caps to reach a goal, rather than haphazardly approaching it. It is important to utilize Time Boxing when trying to reach a goal or number of goals. If time is not allotted carefully, it is often the result of too much time spent on one task. In recent years, I have adopted the idea of planning and prepping in every aspect of my life to avoid stress. I find that having a number of tasks to complete is not necessarily a bad thing, as long as there is planning involved. Assessing and organizing the tasks at hand has helped me to complete tasks in a stress free, timely manner. Additionally, I will test and implement the Pomodoro Technique throughout Phase 0, in order to improve on my current time management strategy.

# 1.2 The Command Line

Simply put, a shell is a macro processor that executes commands and “Bash” is one of the many shells used that is used to interpret command language.
The most challenging part about learning the command line was connecting the different terminology and realizing how each command works together.
I was successfully able to explore and use each command.
The most important commands, to me, are “pwd” and “man.” Print working directory allows you to look at the directory in which you are inside at any given time and the manual is a resource for what each and every command does.
Commands
            -pwd: print working directory

            -ls: list directory

            -mv: move directory

            -cd: change directory

            -../: move “up” in path

            -touch: make a new file

            -mkdir: make a new directory

            -less: page through file one screen at a time

            -rmdir: remove a directory (*may run into error if directory is not empty)

            -rm: remove a file

            -help: acces help screen, which defines each command
