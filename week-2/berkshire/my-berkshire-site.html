  - What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
  It was interesting to reverse the way we worked in this challenge. Instead of looking at HTML code and figuring out what it will look like, we took a site and translated it to code. 

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
  I enjoyed digging deeper into the semantic HTML5 elements and present our code in more specific terms. Semantic elements with a meaning makes the translation of code from developer to system and vice versa, more straightforward. 

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
  Since I have previous experience with HTML and CSS, it was a little difficult to remember to keep it simple and not jump into any additional formatting.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?
  HTML is quick, easy, and flexible, however it comes with trade offs. When it comes to performance and user experience, HTML is not necessarily the best option. In a world full of increasing mobile technology, HTML does not support the experience that users expect.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
  One of the tricks I use is to make sure that whenever I open a tag, I immediately create a matching, closing tag.
