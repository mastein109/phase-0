##What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?
####The primary goal or purpose of my site is to make it appeasing to the eye, informative, and user-friendly. Although I will not be selling a product, I will in a way be 'selling' myself to employers and viewers of my site. I hope to share information about myself and my journey to becoming a developer. My main goal is to make sure my site is up to date, functional, and representative of myself. 

Here is a simple example of my personal

##What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?
My target audience would be the employer's that I am marketing myself to. I want my site to be interactive, while informative and easy to use. I want to address them in an impressionable and professional manner. 

##What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.
The primary wish is for the user, in most cases employers, to explore my achievements and accomplishments. My site will display general information about myself and have links to separate pages to show more detail on my experience and my work. If the employer is interested in my ability, I would ideally want them to contact me through all different modes of communication, which will be provided on my site.

##What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?
###Design and User Experience
Problem-solving and communication are the most important parts of user design. By answering questions about who the target audience is, you can better understand why they are visiting your site and what they wish to achieve while exploring your site. The design part of your site is not for yourself, but your target audience and his or her goals and motivations. It is important to organize and prioritize the information on your site, in order to best communicate with the user. In addition to the content, this will include the size, color, type, and images you will include. User experience is not the same as usability. UX is simply how a user feels when he or she is visiting and using your site and it is quite subjective, since you can't design an experience. You can only do your best to shape that experience into a positive and enjoyable one.

##What is user experience design and why is it valuable? 
User experience design is the experience the people who will use your website has and his or her perception of the site itself. Usability, organization, and presentation will shape the user experience and make your product or service stand out.

##Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
The most tedious part of this challenge was fully understanding and relaying the differences between user design and experience.
