##What is a wireframe?
A wireframe is a design layout of how you will organize the information on your site before you put it into code. It is similar to when a architect draws up a blueprint before they begin building a house. 

##What are the benefits of wireframing?
It is important for the designer to create a wireframe to avoid being distracted by specific design attributes, such as colors, text, and images. A simple black and white wireframe will help the designer get down the fundamentals of the site. It is beneficial in planning how you want the user to process the information on your site.

##Did you enjoy wireframing your site?
I really enjoyed wireframing my site! In fact, I lost track of time and may have spent a little longer than planned without even realizing. I have always been interested in the visual and design aspects of code, so this was particularly fun for me. 

##Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?
I started with a simple idea for a design and began laying it out. However, once I began exploring and playing around with the different attributes, I scrapped my original idea and ended up with a completely different design.

##What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?
During this challenge, I kept in mind the idea of simplicity. Generally, I think it is important not to bombard your user with information.

##Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?
I enjoyed the challenge in whole, but the most tedious part for me was changing my mind on the layout so many times.
