#Reflection
###What is a one-to-one database?
  A one to one database means that each attribute of one entity can only be linked to one entity in another table.
###When would you use a one-to-one database? (Think generally, not in terms of the example you created).
  Generally, you would use a one-to-one database when there are attributes that can be connected to one or zero attributes from another table. For example, each person in the United States can only have one driver's license from one state, or a one-to-one relationship.
###What is a many-to-many database?
  A many-to-many database is when there are two entities or tables that have many attributes linking to a third table or when many items in one table are connected to one item in a second table and many items in the second table are connected to one item in the first table.
###When would you use a many-to-many database? (Think generally, not in terms of the example you created).
  Many-to-many databases can be used in several situations. When a few entities have several attributes connected to one another, many-to-many databases come in handy. For example, when a teacher has several classes of students for the same course and that course can be taught by several different teachers, you have a many-to-many relationship.
###What is confusing about database schemas? What makes sense?
  Schemas are confusing when determining which relationship is best for a certain situation. With anything, practice will help with the confusion.
