// Tally Votes in JavaScript Pairing Challenge.

// This challenge took me [1.25] hours.

// These are the votes cast by each student. Do not alter these objects here.

// Pseudocode
// 1. iterate through votes and pull names by position
// 2. iterate further through position and pull candidate names
// 3. count how many times each candidate name appeared per position
// 4. record number of votes for each candidate for each position in new object
// 5. find the candidate with the most amount of votes
// 6. choose candidate with highest number of votes and record as winner

// __________________________________________
// Initial Solution

// for (var name in votes){
//   for(var position in votes[name]){
//     var candidate = votes[name][position]
//     voteCount[position][candidate] = (voteCount[position][candidate] || 0)+1;
//   }
// }


// for(var position in voteCount){
//   var counter = 0;
//   for(var candidate in voteCount[position]){
//     var votes = voteCount[position][candidate];
//         if (votes > counter) {
//           counter = votes;
//           officers[position] = candidate;
//         }
//     }
// }

//console.log(voteCount);

// Refactored Solution

// __________________________________________
// Reflection
/*
What did you learn about iterating over nested objects in JavaScript?
  We learned you have to go through each nested object in "layers."
Were you able to find useful methods to help you with this?
  The most useful thing we found was the if statement that uses a counter variable to pull the candidate with the highest number of votes.
What concepts were solidified in the process of working through this challenge?
  We originally, tried to use the math.max method to choose the candidate with the highest number of votes, but then found an easier, dryer way of doing that. By doing that, we solidified how to run a counter variable and the specific placement of that variable.
