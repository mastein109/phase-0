##How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?
Chrome's DevTools inspector allows you to adjust positioning and sizing of elements within a webpage. You can adjust the display, position, width, height, margins, padding, and borders. 

##How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?
You can resize elements on the DOM by considering the CSS box model. The box model, from inside-out, contains an area of content surrounded by padding, border, margin, and position.  

##What are the differences between absolute, fixed, static, and relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?
Absolute, fixed, static, and relative are all values of the position property in CSS. Elements are positioned static by default and is positioned by the flow of the page. The relative position is anything but the element's normal position and leaves a gap for the element for where it would be if it had not been positioned. Absolute positioning places an element next to its closest positioned ancestor or containing block. Lastly, fixed positioning means that the element stays in one spot even when scrolling through a page. 

##What are the differences between margin, border, and padding?
Margin, border, and padding are all a part of the CSS box model. The innermost part, the content is surrounded by padding. It creates transparent space between the content and the border. A border goes around both the padding and content. The outermost part of the box model is the margin. The margin creates transparent space outside of the border. 

##What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)
I enjoyed this challenge because it allowed for practice with playing around with positioning visually. In addition, I was able to see the relationship between objects when different positions are defined.
