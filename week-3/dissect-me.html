##Week 1: The Command Line and Version Control

###Git and GitHub

<i>December 5, 2015</i>

<article>This week during DBC Phase 0, I learned and explored the command line and version control. Version control is very beneficial to developers for many reasons. Version control software allows you to perform baisc tasks, such as creating, saving, and editing a document, but doesn't stop there. VCS allows for several developers to work on the same project and even the same file at the same time without overwriting anyone else's work! This prevents errors and possible destruction of files, which is essential to avoid. In addition, version control software is able to track changes from all developers, so everyone can see who edited the file, where it was edited, and what was edited.

<!--What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?
In this challenge, we utilized tags such as <html>, <head>, <title>, and <body>. In addition, when creating our snippet, we used a new tag called <tabTrigger> and <scope>. The former tags are continuously used because those tags are part of the standard html structure. Therefore, when writing HTML, these standard tags will be utilized every time.

How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?
Elements are laid out on a page in the order they are written in a stuctured layout. Semantic elements convey their meaning and purpose clearly to both the developer and browser.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?
I learned that there are many preset and autofill properties. It is nice to have a structure snippet, since the skeleton of all HTML code will almost always be the same. This feature saves time and prevents mistakes in the basic structure of your code. I will definitely create snippets in the future for certain markup that will be reused for similar pages.
